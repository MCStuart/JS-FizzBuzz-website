### Behavioral Driven Development Steps:
| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Verify that the input is a number | a | N/A |
| Returns range of numbers from 0-(user input) | 5 | 0,1,2,3,4,5 |
| If the range contains the digit "1" in any location, change to "Beep!" | 100 | Beep! |
| If the range contains the digit "2" in any location, change to "Boop!" | 20 | Boop! |
| If the range contains the digit "3" in any location, change to "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." | 30 | I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that. |
| Digit 2 overrules digit 1 | 21 | Boop! |
| Digit 3 overrules digits 2 and 1 | 123 | I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that. |
| User should be able to change input without refreshing page to display modified output. | 2 --> 3 | 0, Beep!, Boop! --> 0, Beep!, Boop!, I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that. |
